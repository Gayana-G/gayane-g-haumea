    <section id="About">
        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I am a QA engineer with several years of industry experience under my belt. Over the years, I have had the
            opportunity to gain valuable expertise in ensuring software quality and identifying potential issues. I
            strive
            to be a dedicated professional in my field, constantly learning and improving. With meticulous attention to
            detail and an analytical mindset, I have contributed to the successful delivery of high-quality software
            products. While I have achieved a level of proficiency in QA engineering, I am also eager to explore new
            horizons. I have developed an interest in full-stack development and aspire to expand my skill set in this
            area.
            I understand that there is much to learn on this journey, and I am excited to take on the challenge with a
            humble and open mindset.</p>
